    "## Capstone Project - Car accident severity (Week 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we are going to investigate the severity of the road accidents in the UK. The study is related only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recordered using the STATS19 accident reporting form. \n",
    "\n",
    "Road accidents severity has been an important problem for industry and government for many reasons. For instance, insurance companies would like to understand more the cause of the accident and its severity to help them make the business decisions that would improve the profit. For government, it wants to make the road safer for the gerenal public by improve the road conditions and traffic facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we think it is important to understand the cause of the car accident severity and their impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for understanding the cause of the road accidents in the UK, there the Department for Tranport had made such data avaiable to the public for the first time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained the data from <https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data> for the year of 2018. There are two datasets that are relevant to the study. \n",
    "* Vehicles data\n",
    "* Accidents data\n",
    "\n",
    "All the data variables are coded rather than containing textual strings, a lookup table is downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the accidents data, we can find the severity of the accidents as labelld as 1 to 3, which will be used as the target of the model. In both vehicles and accidents datasets, there are information about the vehicels that invlved in the accidents, and other relevant information such as the location, date, time, weather condition and etc. All of which can be used to determine the most important cause of the accidents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be split into training set and testing set, where the training set is used to form the relationship between the cause and the severity, and the model will be tested on the testing set to verify the performance. \n",

There are 32 columns in the dataset, where **Accident_Severity** is the target of the problem we are try to solve, the column **Accident_Index** is the unique ID that can be used to join different datasets together, for instance, the vehicles dataset below. The rest can be used as the potential factors when predicting the severity. The names of these columns are shown below. \n",

    "We the question we try to address is identify the factors that would have an impact on the severity of an accident if happens, and secondly, when an accident occurs given the information about these factors, what is the severity of the accident. The result is presented by the graph of the decision tree below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis show among the factors found in the datasets, there is no one factor that is significantly relevant to the serverity of an accident according to their Spearman correlation coefficients with the severity. However, a handful of factors are selected what are have relatively high correlation coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "We built a decision tree using the selected factors to predict the severity of an accident. The decision tree that does not have any constrains is very complicated and subject to over-fitting. Then we imposed some requirement on the tree, we set the maximum depth of the tree to be 7 and the minimum sample leaf is 10. The final decision tree has high accuracy score that exceeds 80%. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also note that the decision tree only produce outcomes of severity 2 and 3 based on the given information. It could not be able to predict severity 1 accident, and most of the branches end up of severity 3. There are only two suitations where it results in severity 2 accident. They are:\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that have an impact on the severity of an accident if it happens, and given these information about these factors, what is the severity of the accident. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have identify the following factors that have an impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did police officer attend scene of accident\n",
    "* Skidding and overturning\n",
    "* Vehicle leaving carriageway\n",
    "* Urban or rural area\n",
    "* Vehicle manoeuvre\n",
    "* Hit object in carriageway\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two suitations where it results in severity 2 accident. All the rest suitations would be a severity 3 accident. The decision tree is unable to predict severity 1 accident with the given information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree is easy to understand and intuitive. It has high accuracy score using the testing datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "For insurance companies, they may found the studies does not provide direct advice on their products. However, for govervement and authority, this is particular useful insighs, with these information, the roads can be made safer for the general public, for example, put up more sign on carriageways reminding of the change of layout and provide more police when an accident happens. \n"
